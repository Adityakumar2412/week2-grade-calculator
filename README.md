# Week 2 – Student Grade Calculator
This is my Week 2 project for **The Developers Arena** internship.  
This program calculates student grades, stores results, provides comments, and generates class statistics using Python control flow and data structures.

## 📌 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to create a complete grade calculator that:

- Accepts marks for multiple students  
- Calculates averages  
- Determines grades using if/elif/else  
- Provides personalized comments  
- Stores all results in lists  
- Generates class statistics (average, highest, lowest)  
- Allows searching for a student  
- Saves results to a file  
- Uses loops, functions, and error handling effectively

## 📚 What I Learned
- Decision making using **if/elif/else**  
- **Lists** and nested lists for storing multiple values  
- **For loops** and **while loops** for repetition  
- **Error handling** using try-except  
- Creating **reusable functions**  
- Designing a **menu-driven application**  
- Formatting clean output using f-strings
